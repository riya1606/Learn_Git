Learn to save and manage different versions of your code projects with this essential tool.

## 1. Basic Git Workflow
### A. Hello Git
Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.
### B. Git init
```
git init
```
The word init means initialize. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.
### C. Git Workflow

Nice! We have a Git project. A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:

* A Working Directory: where you’ll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
* A Staging Area: where you’ll list changes you make to the working directory
* A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project.
* <br/>
The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository.
